# Release notes

## future release

* `yarn` is now called directly through `subprocess.run()`. This should resolve some problems in Windows. `pynpm` dependency has been removed.
* Added `customCode` and `customFunctions` arguments for direct javascript use. Also added `getJS()` helper to get the code from a file.
* Now markdown and html in question titles are honored by default.
